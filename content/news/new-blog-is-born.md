# A new blog is born! _tinytech.blog_

On this day, at this hour, a new blog is launched into the world! Will anybody be reading it? Who knows!

If you are reading this - Welcome readers and enjoy your stay! Thank you for visiting and I hope to fill this up with snippets of handy tips, interesting content and maybe something new to learn.

- I want a focus on short and sweet content when it comes to _helpful_ posts, such as 'how to do x' content.
- However there will likely be some more fleshed out posts depending on the topic.
- I want to open this up to accepting guest posts providing they fall in to some guidelines (_to be published_).
