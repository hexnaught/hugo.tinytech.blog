# Welcome to TinyTech.blog !

## About:

- What is this?
- Buh-Whyy ?
- But I like all the infos!
- Can I help/contribute?!

### What is this?

A blog with a focus on short but sweet, accurate, small or single purpose functional posts. All content is to be 'to the point' and shouldn't be taking more than a minute or two to read/filter through. In fact... This page is likely to be the longest post on here!

### Buh-Whyy ?

Sometimes when looking for the answer, we don't want to know the history of bash, git, computer science, the authors wedding, who invented glyphs and the top 10 reasons to use different shells before getting to the answer of...

>
> To display the status of the working directory, with `git` CLI tooling installed, run:
>
> `git status`
>

...in which all we want is _the answer_. More often than not when I have been looking around online for an answer to a problem which is no more than 2 or 3 terminal commands, I come across huge posts, articles, multi-series content write-ups that while can be very in-depth, can also be very.. 'fluffy'.

### But I like all the infos!

...and that is GREAT! I am happy for you! In that case, this blog may be helpful to you on the occasion that you don't want all the info! In the meantime feel free to read those medium and dev.to posts to your heart's content!

### Can I help/contribute?!

YES YOU CAN! There are going to be some guidelines (I don't like the term 'rules' as there can always be some exceptions) to creating a post for the blog that you can submit, along with some 'author' information/metadata unless you want to put a post forward anonymously.

The post will be reviewed with edits or changes requested and if not submitted anonymously we can have a little feedback-loop to ensure the point of the post is not lost.

Then if accepted, we can publish it to a date/time of your liking (or right away!).
